# voice_calculator
 IN DEVELOPMENT! I tried to create a calculator that would have the ability to record expressions from audio recordings and photos. This was my thesis, but it turned out that this is not the format you need a project. I'll finish it in the future.

Calculator with graphical interface. You can still run it from the development environment, in the future as a .exe file. There is a list of memorized expressions.
